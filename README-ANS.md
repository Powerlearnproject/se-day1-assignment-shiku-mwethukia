PART 1
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:
    i. Development of programming languages
In the early days of computing, programming was done using machine code or assembly languages, which were difficult and time-consuming to write and understand. The creation of high-level programming languages like Fortran (1957), COBOL (1959), and later languages like C (1972) allowed developers to write code that was more readable and maintainable. These languages abstracted away the complexities of hardware-specific instructions, making programming accessible to more people and laying the foundation for large-scale software development.

   ii. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
With the rise of complex software, developers needed better ways to manage code complexity. Structured programming, popularized by Edsger Dijkstra and others in the 1960s and 1970s, emphasized the use of control structures like loops and conditionals instead of "goto" statements, which made code difficult to follow. This led to the development of more readable, modular, and maintainable code. The structured programming paradigm influenced software development practices and contributed to the creation of languages such as Pascal and Ada.

  iii. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
In the late 20th century, as software projects became larger and more complex, the limitations of traditional "waterfall" development models became evident. Agile methodologies, like Scrum and XP (Extreme Programming), emerged in response to the need for flexibility and responsiveness to change. The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and adapting to evolving requirements. Agile transformed the software development process by promoting continuous improvement, frequent deliveries, and close customer interaction, making it a core methodology in modern software engineering.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
    i. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
   ii. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  iii. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
   iv. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
    v. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
   vi. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Waterfall and Agile methodologies
i. Waterfall methodology - It is a linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) is completed before moving on to the next. This methodology assumes that requirements are well understood from the beginning and unlikely to change. This method is inflexible once the project starts. It follows a set plan, and changes are challenging and costly to implement after the requirements phase. It works best in projects with stable, well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change. It would be appropriate in projects like building an enterprise system or database, where all requirements are clear and must be followed step-by-step, benefit from Waterfall’s structured approach. This ensures that everything is built to plan with minimal rework.

ii. Agile methodology - It is an iterative and incremental approach. It breaks down projects into smaller units called "sprints" or "iterations," each of which includes planning, design, development, and testing. Agile accommodates changing requirements, allowing continuous improvement based on feedback. Agile is highly adaptable, with a focus on regular feedback from stakeholders to refine the project as it progresses. This method is well-suited to projects where requirements might evolve based on feedback or market demands. It would be appropriate in projects like e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, or web applications benefit from Agile because they need continuous updates and improvements based on user feedback.

Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.

Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process
 IDEs streamline the coding process by integrating various tools and features in one unified workspace, significantly enhancing developer productivity and reducing errors. They typically include code editors, debugging tools, compilers, and testing frameworks, all of which help developers write, test, and troubleshoot code more efficiently. IDEs also often support code completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking, which reduce the cognitive load on developers and help maintain code consistency and quality. Examples are: VS Code, Pycharm, IntelliJ

 Version Control Systems are critical for tracking and managing changes in code across multiple developers, teams, and iterations. They allow developers to maintain different versions of a project, revert to previous states if needed, and merge contributions from multiple team members. This ensures that the codebase is always backed up, organized, and easy to roll back in case of errors or bugs, making VCS indispensable for both individual and team-based development. Examples are: Git, Subversion, Mercurial

 Challenges faced by software engineers
    i. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. It can be overcome by adopting Agile practices that embrace iterative development, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in handling changes.
   ii. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. It can be overcome by using Task Management Tools like Trello, Jira, or Asana to help track tasks and prioritize based on project timelines and deadlines.
  iii. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. It can be overcome by treating technical debt as part of the project backlog and prioritize it like any other feature. Make sure project stakeholders understand the long-term benefits of paying down debt to improve project sustainability.

Unit Testing - It involves testing individual components or modules of software. Ensures individual components work as expected, providing a solid foundation for further testing.

Integration Testing: It involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.  Verifies that components interact correctly, ensuring stable module interactions within the system.

System Testing: It involves testing the entire software system as a whole. Tests the full application, ensuring it behaves as intended and meets overall requirements.

Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. Confirms the application meets user needs and business objectives, authorizing it for production release.

PART 2
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Its importance in interacting with AI models is enhanced response quality, efficiency and productivity, error reduction and control and usability for non-technical users.

Vague Prompt: "Create a report about the project."

Improved Prompt: "Create a 2-page summary report on the project’s current progress, including key milestones achieved, challenges faced, and next steps. Please target the report for stakeholders with limited technical knowledge."

The improved prompt is more effective because it is:
    i. Clear: It specifies the report’s purpose (project progress) and outlines exactly what information to include (milestones, challenges, next steps).
   ii. Concise: It avoids unnecessary words but communicates the necessary details succinctly.
  iii. Specific: It defines the length (2 pages) and audience (non-technical stakeholders), which helps tailor the language and depth of information accordingly.
By being clear, concise, and specific, the improved prompt removes ambiguity, enabling the recipient to deliver a report that meets expectations more efficiently.
